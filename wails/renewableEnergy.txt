The Science of Renewable Energy

Energy is the ability to do work, and it exists in many forms, including mechanical, radiant, 
chemical, and electrical. Sources of energy are generally categorized into two groups: 
renewable and non-renewable.

1. Solar Energy: 
Radiant energy from the sun is captured using photovoltaic (PV) cells. These cells 
transform sunlight directly into electricity. A major advantage of solar power is that 
it is inexhaustible, although it is dependent on weather conditions and time of day.

2. Wind Power: 
Wind turbines use the kinetic energy of moving air to spin a generator. This generator 
transforms mechanical energy into electrical energy. An instrument called an 
anemometer is used to measure the velocity of the wind to determine the best 
placement for these turbines.

3. Hydropower: 
This is the most prevalent renewable energy source globally, accounting for nearly 60% 
of renewable electricity. It relies on the flow of water (rivers or dams) to turn 
turbines.

4. Important Vocabulary:
- Convection: The transfer of thermal energy in a fluid (gas or liquid) by currents.
- Generator: A device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
- Fossil Fuels: Non-renewable resources like coal, oil, and natural gas which currently 
  provide 80-85% of the world's energy.

Statistics: 
While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population, it consumes approximately 
17% of the world's energy. Transitioning to renewable technologies could save an 
estimated $12 trillion globally by 2050.
